This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for librarians with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses examples that are relevant to a wide range of library use cases,
and is designed to be used as a prerequisite lesson for other Python based lessons
that will be developed in the future, e.g. using the Pandas for data analysis.

>    what a working directory is,
